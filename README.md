# RL-Maze

This repository contains code for a senior physics project exploring reinforcement learning in stochastic grid mazes.

## Files
- `30x30 slippery.py` — Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for a slippery maze environment.
- `Actor-Critic with Eligibility Traces (Classical).py` — Tabular Actor–Critic implementation used for conceptual development.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run the desired Python file directly to train the agent and generate learning curves.
